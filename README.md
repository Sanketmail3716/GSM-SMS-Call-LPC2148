# GSM-SMS-Call-LPC2148
This project uses the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller with a GSM module (SIM800L) to receive SMS messages, parse them, send automated SMS replies, and initiate voice calls based on message content. It demonstrates UART communication, interrupt handling, and real-time GSM control in embedded systems.
